## My process

### Built with

-  Semantic HTML5 markup
-  CSS custom properties
-  Flexbox

### What I learned

I didn't learned anything but i had a pretty good reminder of basic HMTL5 and CSS3 and how flexbox work, although it makes me think about the way i prefer encapsulating images in a div box, it allows me to add border or other style easily, i wonder if there is another way to it efficiently

```html
<div class="imgframe">
   <img class="QR-img" src="./images/image-qr-code.png" alt="A QR code image that you scan with your phone QR code scanner" />
</div>
```

### Continued development

For now, nothing, it is just a plain display of a QR code, maybe a little change to the design could be nice, it could be more fitted to bigger screen, i should take inspiration from the google chromecast UI

### Useful resources

-  [for classes properties ](https://www.w3schools.com) - when working with basic html and css, it's the best ressource to get
